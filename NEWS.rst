======================================

**WARNING:** this is a security update.

CairoSVG was vulnerable to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks, this release
fixes this vulnerability by not resolving the XML entities anymore.

The ``--unsafe`` option has been added to force the resolution of XML
entities. Obviously, this option is not safe and should only be used with
trusted SVG files.
